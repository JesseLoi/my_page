But to understand what this means we have to ask what it can mean to guarantee that we can perform these steps. It is not enough merely to guarantee that the step is in accordance with the postulates, but the postulates themselves have to be 'guaranteed/ 1 take this to be the point of the following passage from the Observation on the Second Antinomy (A439/B46
