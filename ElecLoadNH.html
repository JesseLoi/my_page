            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Given climate reports such as temperature and humidity, can we predict the electricty load, or how much electricity is used in the city of New Hampshire? We will see which regression methods or worth trying and which features contribute most to the phenomenon. At a first glance, we might hypothesize that temperature and time of day might increase electricity load. After all, people tend to use air conditioning in high temperature and start their personal devices as soon as they get home from work (usually 5PM).
                We'll use cross validation to check our guesses and compare our linear regression. More importantly, our discoveries will help guage proper factors in determining electricity allocation for electrical and civil engineers and when to buy and sell electricity for personal traders. After all, trading electricity can serve to be quite a lucrative occupation.</p>
            <p>As for technologies we'll use, we'll make use of Python's many machine learning libraries for regression.</p>

</div>
            <p>Let "RT_Demand" stand for the electricity load, what we want to predict.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Find the data at https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/load-and-demand/-/tree/whlsecost-hourly-newhampshire</p>
            
            <p>The first question to answer is how we will be evaluating our models. We could, for instance, simply wait for the data to come in. However, this takes too long. Instead, with our limited data, we will attempt cross-validation. Let's train our algorithms on all but the last month and we will attempt to predict the last month (December 2022). This is 
            so that we aren't training our data on our test data.</p>
            
            <p>We'll start with some exploratory data analysis to see some initial trends in the data. We have the following interesting features to inspect: date, time, temperature, and their corresponding transformations.</p>

            <p>Date: naturally, the date, particularly the weekend/weekday distinction, should be a contributor to electricity load. For example, lots of businesses won't be operating during the weekend, lowering power usage.

            <p>We'll now consider machine learning algorithms other than linear </p>
            <h2>Bagging</h2>
            <p>Let's try bagging (bootstrap aggregatting), which is a process where we sample several times from the table to create different models. We'll then average (or aggregate) these models together.</p>

            <h2>K-Nearest Neighbor</h2>

            <h2>Random Forest</h2>

            <p>With this selection of black-box algorithms, it might be tough for our linear regression to keep up. Let's see what we can do.</p>

            <h2>Linearizing the Non-Linear</h2>
    <p>From our data analysis above, we have one fundamental problem. That is </p>

        <section id="section3">
            <h2>Interesting Results</h2>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, it was a "black box" regression method, the Random Forest method, which performed best. Minimizing mean-squared error the most among the different methodologies.</p>
            <p><b>However</b>, not all is lost. Our linear regression, with its many different features, arrived surprisingly close  to the mean-squared error. Even better, such results performed significantly better than other linear regressions that used far more features. This is keeping in mind that the phenomena we were attempting to predict was a non-linear phenomena (electricity usage).</p>
            <p>The lesson to take away here is that, with enough crafty transformations, we can linearize phenomena that is usually non-linear. While it might be better at regression than methods such as random forests, this allows us to have some more oversight over the regression formula than we would with a machine-learning method such as random forest.</p>
            <p>Of course, this isn't anything too new. This was already discussed in Tim Hesterberg's work on regression in electricity load[A REGRESSION-BASED APPROACH TO SHORT-TERM SYSTEM LOAD FORECASTING 1990]</p>
