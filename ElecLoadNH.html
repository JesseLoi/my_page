            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Given climate reports such as temperature and humidity, can we predict the electricty load, or how much electricity is used in the city of New Hampshire? We will see which regression methods or worth trying and which features contribute most to the phenomenon. At a first glance, we might hypothesize that temperature and time of day might increase electricity load. After all, people tend to use air conditioning in high temperature and start their personal devices as soon as they get home from work (usually 5PM).
                We'll use cross validation to check our guesses and compare our linear regression.</p>

            <h2>Interesting Results</h2>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, it was a "black box" regression method, the Random Forest method, which performed best. Minimizing mean-squared error the most among the different methodologies.</p>
            <p><b>However</b>, not all is lost. Our linear regression, with its many different features, arrived surprisingly close  to the mean-squared error. Even better, such results performed significantly better than other linear regressions that used far more features. This is keeping in mind that the phenomena we were attempting to predict was a non-linear phenomena (electricity usage).</p>
            <p>The lesson to take away here is that, with enough crafty transformations, we can linearize phenomena that is usually non-linear. While it might be better at regression than methods such as random forests, this allows us to have some more oversight over the regression formula than we would with a machine-learning method such as random forest.</p>
            <p>Of course, this isn't anything too new. This was already discussed in Tim Hesterton's work on regression in electricity load[CITATION NEEDED]</p>
